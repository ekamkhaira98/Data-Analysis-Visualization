A few months back, I saw a new son how in the Ring of Fire region on the world which is closer to Japan, Earth's Crust movement has been noticed in a certain pattern which leads to Tsunami in that particular region. With this project, I'm trying to make an effort at a foundational level for more accurate and faster tsunami warnings by-
* Finding the countries with highest magnitude of Tsunami.
* Finding the countries with highest death toll due to this catastrophe.
* Searching the nations which have borne most financial loss.
* Analysing the regions/ countries with least and highest houses destroyed.
* Understanding the regions with heaviest impact of Tsunami in the country which has suffered the most
* Analysing the patterns and frequency of Tsunamis in the different regions.

Tools and Technologies Used- Google Cloud Platform, Google Data Studio
