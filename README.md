A few months back, I saw a new son how in the Ring of Fire region on the world which is closer to Japan, Earth's Crust movement has been noticed in a certain pattern which leads to Tsunami in that particular region. With this project, I'm trying to make an effort at a foundational level for more accurate and faster tsunami warnings by-
* Finding the countries with highest magnitude of Tsunami.
* Finding the countries with highest death toll due to this catastrophe.
* Searching the nations which have borne most financial loss.
* Analysing the regions/ countries with least and highest houses destroyed.
* Understanding the regions with heaviest impact of Tsunami in the country which has suffered the most
* Analysing the patterns and frequency of Tsunamis in the different regions.

Tools and Technologies Used- Google Cloud Platform, Google Data Studio

* Dataset is collected from The Global Historical Tsunami Database maintained by (NOAA) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
* Information of More than 2400 Tsunamis since 200 BC
* 2 Tables â€“ Tsunami Source Event and Tsunami Run Ups
* Over 44 columns and 36 columns in each table respectively.
* Null values have been omitted while querying the tables in order to get correct analyses.


Finding of Analysis-
* Japan has faced the biggest Financial as well as human loss till date to the Tsunamis.
* Miyako Region of Japan has incurred the largest Capital Loss due to Tsunamis.
* Probability of occurrence of Tsunami in Miyako in first quarter of the year is very likely.
* Yaizu region in Japan has suffered the most casualities in totality till date.
