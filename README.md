# Google Analytics Project- Tsunami Data Analysis and Visualization

A few months back, I saw a new son how in the Ring of Fire region on the world which is closer to Japan, Earth's Crust movement has been noticed in a certain pattern which leads to Tsunami in that particular region. With this project, I'm trying to make an effort at a foundational level for more accurate and faster tsunami warnings by-
* Finding the countries with highest magnitude of Tsunami.
* Finding the countries with highest death toll due to this catastrophe.
* Searching the nations which have borne most financial loss.
* Analysing the regions/ countries with least and highest houses destroyed.
* Understanding the regions with heaviest impact of Tsunami in the country which has suffered the most
* Analysing the patterns and frequency of Tsunamis in the different regions.

Tools and Technologies Used- Google Cloud Platform, Google Data Studio

* Dataset is collected from The Global Historical Tsunami Database maintained by (NOAA) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
* Information of More than 2400 Tsunamis since 200 BC
* 2 Tables – Tsunami Source Event and Tsunami Run Ups
* Over 44 columns and 36 columns in each table respectively.
* Null values have been omitted while querying the tables in order to get correct analyses.


Finding of Analysis-
* Japan has faced the biggest Financial as well as human loss till date to the Tsunamis.
* Miyako Region of Japan has incurred the largest Capital Loss due to Tsunamis.
* Probability of occurrence of Tsunami in Miyako in first quarter of the year is very likely.
* Yaizu region in Japan has suffered the most casualities in totality till date.

Conclusion-
I aim at developing a alert system where we can notify specific areas based upon the danger zones which they lie in. This would be really helpful for the government bodies as well as the citizens to be aware of. It also reduces the risk of loss of capital and the damage caused by this natural disasters.
